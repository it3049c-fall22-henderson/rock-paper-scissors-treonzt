## Self-Evaluation: 
I would say I deserve a 12/20 on this, I did parts 1-3 and tried doing the last part but the site wasn't working correctly when I finished it.
## Team Reflection:
I struggled with this last portion...I tried to look up why my code wasn't functioning but wasn't able to figure it out. I tried using a javascript code validator but it wasn't much of a help. After I finished part 4 the site wasn't responding to input with the computer's choice and the result of the game


### How long it took us to finish this?
Around an hour
